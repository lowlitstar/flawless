â˜† flawless pre-release-v.0.4.0 for obsidian 1.0.0+ 
  created by @sahdudeone
  !! this theme is currently unfinished !!

  - current theme functionality is extremely limited,
  for now, flawless brings a brand new color scheme, some small ui tweaks, it also allows for styling text by using inline html element within your notes (such as `<span class="red">this is text!</span>`); to learn about it and see it in action check out this handy [reference sheet](https://publish.obsidian.md/sahdudeone/%E2%98%86+flawless/%E2%98%86+flawless+styling+guide) (:
