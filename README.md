â˜† flawless pre-release-v0.5.1 for obsidian 1.0.0+ 
  created by @sahdudeone
  !! this theme is currently unfinished !!

  - current theme functionality is extremely limited,
  for now, flawless brings a brand new color scheme, some small ui tweaks, it also allows for styling text by using inline html element within your notes (such as `<span class="red">this is text!</span>`); to learn about it and see it in action check out this handy [reference sheet](https://sahdude.one/p/flawless) (:
