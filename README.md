  !! this theme is currently unfinished !!

  current theme functionality is extremely limited,
  for now, flawless brings a brand new color scheme,
  aswell as also allowing for styling text by using inline html element within your notes; to learn about it check out this handy [reference sheet](https://publish.obsidian.md/sahdudeone/%E2%98%85+flawless/%E2%98%86+flawless+styling+guide) (:
