â˜† flawless pre-release-v.0.1 for obsidian 1.0.0+ 
  created by @sahdudeone
  THIS THEME IS UNFINISHED 

  current theme functionality is extremely limited,
  for now, the theme only allows for styling text by calling
  preset css classes using inline html elements like '<span>'
  within your notes; copy this handy [reference sheet](https://github.com/sahdudeone/flawless/blob/main/pre-release-v.0.1%20text%20styling%20reference%20sheet.md?plain=1) into obsidian (:
  
this is my first experience using GitHub & also Git, bear with me please!!
